# practiceprojects

This is where I store my collection of projects I did to practice my skills.


Some projects here are from youtubers like [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez)

The idea is from them but I did the projects from scratch by applying what I learned from the lessons. 

Some of them are made intentionally bad at the design because I'm bad at that department but it's functional (might fix this in the future in case I'll need it).

I hope this repo will help some of you to learn and hopefully help you to build your own projects.
